Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-->software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the development, design, testing and maintenance of a software.
-->improtance
 A. Development of IoT and AI
 B. testing and maintenance of software applications
 C. Automation and robotics
 D. Data analytics


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

--> The development of programming languages
--> The develoopment of software engineering as a decipline
--> The development of Agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

-->Requirement :- in this phase the software engineer will gather information about user need and software requirements.
-->design :- in this phase the software engineer will design the software architecture and user interface.
-->Implementation :- in this phase the software engineer will write the code and build the software as the user requirement and specification.
-->testing:- in this phase the software engineer will test the developed software if there exist any errors and make sure it meets the user specification.
-->Deployment:- in this phase the software engineer will release the software to the users.
-->Maintenance:- in this phase the software engineer will do an on going maintenance and updates to the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

--> Waterfall methodology follows a linear step by step approach. step by step starting form requirement to the maintenance phase of SDLC, while Agile 
    methodology focus on iterative development and incremental improvements.where each iteration involves planning, development, testing, and review.
 scenarios
    Waterfall methodology:- Banking Software System which doesn't require any frequent updates.
    Agile methodology:- E-commerce Website here in this project users need frequent updates as the trending of the market.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

--> Software Developer:- responsible for writting the code for the application based on user requirement and specification.
--> Quality Assurance Enegineer:- responsible for developing test plans and test cases based on requirements to ensure the software meets quality     
    standards.
--> Project manager:- oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

--> IDEs are software application that a software engineer uses to write nad debug the code he/she wrote.
--> vcs are also software applications that developers uses to see and check if any changes are made to the source code and when they need to work co- 
    opratively on a project.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

--> Balancing Quality and Speed 
      using Use agile methodologies to iteratively improve and deliver.
--> Handling Technical Debt
      prioritize addressing technical debt in sprints, and maintain good coding practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

--> Unit testing :- is testing of units in isolation from the other units
          is important to know if there are problems in early stage of the development by checking if all units work correctly.

--> Integration testing:- is testing of the diffrent units if they work together.
          is important to ensure that the wethier the units together work correctly or not.

--> System testing:- is testing of the whole system if it works correctly or not.
          is important to ensure that the system works correctly as the user expectation and requirement before deploying.

--> Acceptance testing:- is testing of the application form the user perspective to ensure if it meets the requirement.
          is important to ensure that the software is ready to be deliverd to the users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

--> Prompt engineering is the use of specific and right question asking to get the most out of an AI. It's importance is to reduce unwanted and less 
    usefull information that the AI can give us and also to reduce vague answers.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
--> "tell me about football" this is a vague prompt because the AI will give us a lot of information that we didn't inteded to know
     to make is more clear and specific we can say "write me about the rules and regulations about football and also some of the greatest footballers for 
     some one who is new to football" this is more clear and specific prompt.
